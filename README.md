## What is OOP?
* OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm or approach to software development. It is a way of organizing and designing code based on the concept of objects.

* In OOP, we think about a program as a collection of objects that interact with each other to perform tasks. An object is a specific instance of a class, which can be thought of as a blueprint or template for creating objects. Objects have their own properties (attributes or data) and behaviors (methods or functions).

***To understand OOP, let's use an analogy:***

Imagine you have a class called "Car." The class represents the blueprint for creating cars. It defines the properties that all cars have, such as color, model, and speed, as well as the actions they can perform, such as starting, accelerating, and stopping.

Now, if you want to create an actual car, you would instantiate an object from the "Car" class. This object would have its own specific color, model, and speed. You can interact with the car object by calling its methods to perform actions like starting the engine or accelerating.
