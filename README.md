## What is OOP?
* OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm or approach to software development. It is a way of organizing and designing code based on the concept of objects.

* In OOP, we think about a program as a collection of objects that interact with each other to perform tasks. An object is a specific instance of a class, which can be thought of as a blueprint or template for creating objects. Objects have their own properties (attributes or data) and behaviors (methods or functions).

***To understand OOP, let's use an analogy:***

Imagine you have a class called "Car." The class represents the blueprint for creating cars. It defines the properties that all cars have, such as color, model, and speed, as well as the actions they can perform, such as starting, accelerating, and stopping.

Now, if you want to create an actual car, you would instantiate an object from the "Car" class. This object would have its own specific color, model, and speed. You can interact with the car object by calling its methods to perform actions like starting the engine or accelerating.

### Key concepts in OOP include:
* *Classes*: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have. Objects are created from classes using a process called **instantiation**.

* *Objects*: Objects are instances of classes. They represent specific instances of the entity modeled by the class. Each object has its own set of attributes and can perform actions defined by the class's methods.

* *Encapsulation*: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods together within a class, hiding internal details and providing a public interface for interacting with the object. It helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding.

  ***Let's explain these concepts in more detail***
  - *Classes:*
     * A class is like a blueprint or template that defines the characteristics and behaviors of         objects. It describes the properties (attributes) an object of that class will have and the          actions (methods) it can perform.
   
     * Think of a class as a definition or a recipe for creating objects. Just as a blueprint for a       house defines its structure, a class defines the structure of objects.
   
     * For example, let's consider a "Car" class. It might have attributes like "color," "model,"         and "speed," and methods like "start," "accelerate," and "stop." Objects created from this           class will have their own color, model, speed, and can perform actions like starting,                accelerating, and stopping.
  - *Objects:*
      * An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence or realization of       the entity described by the class.
   
      * Think of objects as actual things created based on a class. If a class is like a                 blueprint, an object is like a physical object built from that blueprint.
