# Switch Statement:

	* The switch statement is a control flow statement that allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of a variable or an expression. It provides a concise and efficient way to handle multiple cases in your code.

```cpp switch (expression)
{
    case value1:
        // code block executed if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code block executed if expression equals value2
        break;
    // more cases...
    default:
        // code block executed if none of the above cases match
        break;
} ````

	* The expression is evaluated, and its value is compared with the values listed after each case keyword.

	* If the value of the expression matches a case value, the code block following that case is executed. This is known as "falling through" to the matching case.

	* After executing the code block of a matched case, the break statement is used to exit the switch block and prevent execution of subsequent cases. Without the break statement, execution would continue to the next case, even if it doesn't match the expression's value.

	* If none of the case values match the expression value, the code block following the default keyword is executed. The default case is optional and typically used as a catch-all case for unmatched values. It's recommended to include a default case to handle unexpected or invalid values.

	* The break statement is used to exit the switch statement after executing the code block of a matched case or the default case. It's important to include break statements to avoid unintended fall-through behavior.
